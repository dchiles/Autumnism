	<p>My name is Dylan G. Chiles. You wanna learn a bit more about me, eh? Well, there's a bit to tell but I'll keep to the essentials. I was born in Bathurst, NSW, Australia on the 12th of August 2003. I enjoyed my training and experience in HTML and CSS coding and I absolutely love history and studying strategy. Reading is a fun pastime for me when I get bored or just feel like reading. I enjoy socialising both online and offline. I enjoy all forms of animals, particularly the domesticated kind.</p>
